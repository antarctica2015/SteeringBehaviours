please note this source code has external dependancies on -

ogre3d - http://www.ogre3d.org/
ogrenewt- http://walaber.com/index.php?action=showitem&id=9
newton game dynamics - http://www.newtondynamics.com/

and common code from the book "Programming Game AI by Example" by Matt Buckland.
http://www.ai-junkie.com/books/toc_pgaibe.html

all of which are too big to be included in this file, please see the indvidual sites concerned for setup details

therefore unfortunately it wont just compile & run "out the box" - check the project settings for dependancies etc
