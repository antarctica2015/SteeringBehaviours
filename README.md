Steering Behaviours

This is an older proof of concept demo that uses techniques and code provided in the book "Programming Game AI by Example" by Matt Buckland. 

The demo showed off a number of different steering behaviours including flocking running under the Ogre3d rendering engine.
Note: This version of the demo is built on top of Ogre3D, Ogrenewt, CEGUI, Newton Game Dynamics and requires DirectX 9 (at least Aug 2006) to run.
