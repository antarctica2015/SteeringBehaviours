Steering Behaviours
-------------------------

This is an older proof of concept demo that uses techniques and code provided in the book "Programming Game AI by Example" by Matt Buckland. 

The demo showed off a number of different steering behaviours including flocking running under the Ogre3d rendering engine.
Note: This version of the demo is built on top of Ogre3D, Ogrenewt, CEGUI, Newton Game Dynamics and requires DirectX 9 (at least Aug 2006) to run.
