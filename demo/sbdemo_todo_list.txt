- rewrite & improve readme / manual
- add in proper world bounds for AIWorld (see OgreNewt)
- add wall/terrain avoidance behaviour
- improve all other behaviours stability/speed
- GUI: add mouse wheel support
- add a range/distance modifier to flee behaviour [Done]
- add physics based collision detection & response via OgreNewt

- add in A* pathfinding [moved to seperate demo to be created later]
- decouple A* decisions from movement (locomotion) layer & remove current "razor.mesh" dependancy towards a generic ai framework
- create line3d, box3d, circle3d, sphere3d classes for visualisation options
- improve code stability, programming style, ledgability etc
- rewrite all code with improved interface suitable for .dll creation to allow others to use it as a plug in
