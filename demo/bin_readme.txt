This *WIP* steering behaviours demo is based upon techniques and code provided in the book "Programming Game AI by Example" by Matt Buckland.

you can pick different behaviours from the menu in top right corner

Controls:

escape : quit

Arrow keys : pan & scroll 
- & + : zoom in/out

mouse 1 : change target point (in seek, arrive, flee, obstacle avoidance demos)
mouse 2 : hold to rotate view (needs work)
mouse 4 : zoom in
mouse 5 : zoom out

improvements to follow shortly!



PLEASE NOTE:

Some users might get the error:

"This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem" due to missing VC8 libraries on their system- i have included an installer for these if required
